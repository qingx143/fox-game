# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory
# The original version comes from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore
# It has been modified to allow Unity projects to be placed in subfolders of your Git repository.

# If you have folders named "obj", "library" or "temp", they will always be ignored wherever they are in the project.
# If you want to avoid this, remove the "**" and replace it with the real folder name.
